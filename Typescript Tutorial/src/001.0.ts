// any (super type) --> the any type is a special type that can represent values of any data type. It is a way to opt out of the

// null and undefined types
// The value undefined means value is not assigned & you donâ€™t know its value. It is an 
// unintentional absence of value. It means that a variable has been declared but has not 
// yet been assigned a value.The value null indicates that you know that the field does 
// not have a value. It is an intentional absence of value.
// Whenever we declare a variable without initializing it with a value, TypeScript 
// initializes it as undefined. But TypeScript never assigns null to any variable. We have 
// to assign Null to variable to make it null.

let a: undefined;          // a is a variable of type undefined
// The only value that we can assign to an undefined variable is undefined.  
// We can assign null only if StrictNullCheck is disabled). Any other values like 
// string, object, numbers, etc are not allowed.

// The only value that we can assign to it is null.  We can also assign undefined 
// only if StrictNullCheck is disabled.
